# Introduction

This is the very beginning of the embedded interview handbook.

## Getting Started

This guide format is based off of the [Tech Interview Handbook](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/)

Please feel free to contribute.

## Start the site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/getting-started.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
